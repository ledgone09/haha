```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add multiplayer functionality"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. **Check server logs** in Render dashboard
2. **Verify CORS settings** match your domain
3. **Test locally first** with `npm run dev:full`

### Performance
1. **Monitor player count** - Render starter plan handles ~10-20 concurrent players
2. **Check memory usage** in Render metrics
3. **Optimize if needed** - reduce sync frequency

### Common Fixes
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules server/node_modules
npm install
cd server && npm install

# Reset git if needed
git reset --hard HEAD
```
